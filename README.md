## Topic:
Suscepitibility to lung cancer based on lifestyle and demographic paramters such as age, gender, alcohol use, genetic risk, and smoking. 

## Reason For Topic:
Being able to predict and determine the level or stage of cancer a patient has greatly affects their treatment options.

## Questions to Answer:
Which aspects of a persons lifestyle would make them most susceptible to lung cancer? We analyzed the data of 1000 lung cancer patients with respect to different parameters such as their age, gender, alcohol use, genetic risk, and smoking. The purpose is to predict which lifestyle choices would lead to lung cancer.
