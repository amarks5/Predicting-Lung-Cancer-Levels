## Communication Protocols:
We will primarily communicate through the Zoom and Slack platforms.  We have scheduled a Zoom call on Tuesday nights and confirmed everyone is available throughout the day via Slack.  In addition, we have exchanged email addresses and phone numbers as alternative forms of communication. 

## Topic:
The susceptibility to lung cancer based on the following 23 lifestyle and demographic variables: age, gender, air pollution, alcohol use, dust allergy, occupational hazards, genetic risk, chronic lung disease, balanced diet, obesity, smoking, passive smoker, chest pain, coughing of blood, fatigue, weight loss, shortness of breath, wheezing, swallowing difficulty, clubbing of finger nails, frequent cold, dry cough, and snoring.  

## Reason For Topic:
Understanding the Being able to predict and determine the level or stage of cancer a patient has greatly affects their treatment options. 
## Description of Data Source:
This dataset was sourced from Kaggle, a community forum of datasets. It shows the demographic and lifestyle data of 100 lung cancer patients.

## Questions to Answer:
Which aspects of a person's lifestyle would make them most susceptible to lung cancer? We analyzed the data of 1000 lung cancer patients with respect to different parameters such as their age, gender, alcohol use, genetic risk, and smoking. The purpose is to predict which lifestyle choices would lead to lung cancer.
