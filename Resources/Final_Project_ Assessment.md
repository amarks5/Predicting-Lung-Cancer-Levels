# Final Project Assessment

## Initially, Alexis brought up the idea of creating a model to predict lung cancer based on a person�s symptoms. After searching for data sources to accomplish this goal, we stumbled upon a data set in Kaggle which included a survey of 1,000 cancer patients. Within the survey, there was a column for each patient�s level of cancer. The level of each patient�s cancer was identified as low, medium, or high. Rather than predicting lung cancer based on a person�s symptoms, we decided to move forward with using the Kaggle data set and create a model to predict a person�s level of cancer based on risk characteristics.

## Again, Alexis led the way by creating our git hub and branches. Doris and I started the exploratory data analysis. The data was made up of 24 risk characteristics made up of demographics, lifestyle elements and symptoms for each patient. There were only two demographic data points: age and gender. I found the level of cancer somewhat evenly distributed between the ages (14 -73) and gender (male or female) within the data set. Even though I found a few outliers within older patients, the data only included 134 patients over the age of 50 so the outliers would not make a huge impact and could be left in the data set. The average age of the patients was 37 years old. I also reviewed the data statistics within the entire data set and within each level of cancer to better understand the 24 risk characteristics. The lifestyle elements and symptoms were made up of survey scores using a Likert scale of 0 -10. I created several graphs to display my findings which Jesse used to create the dashboard. I exported the data into SQL and Doris continued with the exploratory data analysis. 

## I ran the .corr() function and created a heat map of the correlation between the risk characteristics and found Air Pollution, Alcohol Use, Dust Allergy, OccuPational Hazards, Genetic Risks, chronic Lung Disease, Balanced Diet, Obesity, Smoking Passive Smoker, Chest Pain and Coughing of Blood were most correlated and highly impacted a patient�s level of cancer. The function SelectkBest supported these findings and we found only 13 risk characteristics would be needed for our supervised machine learning model. Ali created the model and our website to complete our project and show that certain risk characteristics could be used to determine a lung cancer patient�s level of cancer.

## Overall, we worked well together and were able to complete the project on time. We all worked on our portion of the presentation individually and I assisted in organizing the git hub and editing the README.md file for our completed project. The most difficult aspect of this assignment was finding time to work with one another. We all have different schedules and I feel with more time we could have improved our verbal presentation and worked together to integrate our python code into one file.
